üß† Task: Extract Method Refactoring and Test Generation for dft
You are tasked with improving the testability of an MPI-based implementation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Your goal is to refactor the function into smaller, testable methods, and then generate unit tests for the new methods.

üìçTarget Function
File: generated-code.hpp

Function:
	void dft(std::vector<double> const& x, std::vector<std::complex<double>> &output)
Description: This is an MPI-based parallel implementation of the DFT. You will be performing extract method refactorings to improve testability.

‚úÖ Your Tasks (Step-by-Step)
Step 1: Recommend Refactoring
Analyze the target function and provide:

A list of recommended extract method refactorings

For each, include:

1. Line numbers of code to be extracted

2. A justification for why it should be extracted (e.g., isolation of pure logic, reducing MPI dependencies, improving reuse or readability)

Step 2: Perform Refactoring
Refactor the code as per your recommendations by extracting the selected regions into named functions.

Each new function should reside in the same file or a nearby helper file.

Refactor with unit testability in mind: prefer pure functions, parameterize I/O, and isolate side effects where possible.

Step 3: Recommend Tests
For each extracted method, recommend one or more unit tests.

For each test, provide:

1. A brief description of the test

2. A justification (e.g., boundary case, correctness of loop logic, complex number handling)

Step 4: Generate Tests
Implement the recommended tests and place them in a test/ directory.

Choose a C++ testing framework (e.g., Google Test, Catch2, or your own test harness).

Include a simple CMakeLists.txt or compile script if needed.

The test suite should only test the extracted methods, not MPI itself.

üß™ Sanity Check
To verify that your refactoring has not altered behavior:

Run:

./build-driver.sh
./run-driver.sh

This compares the output of your refactored MPI implementation to a serial DFT. You must pass this check.

‚öôÔ∏è Environment Requirements
You must install MPI (e.g., OpenMPI or MPICH) to compile and run this project.

All dependencies should be available through standard package managers or documented clearly.
